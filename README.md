# stackexchange-toggle-spoilers
A UserScript for Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy StackExchange to allow toggling of spoiler markdown

This script creates a checkbox in the "Question Info" sidebar block of all questions on SFF.SE. When the checkbox is enabled, all spoiletext in spoiler markdown (which is normally hidden unless the cursor hovers over the text) is made visible.
